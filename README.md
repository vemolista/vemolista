### Hi, I'm Tomas ðŸ‘‹ I care about shipping crisp FE code

Currently working at [Lun](https://lun.energy) as a Business Engineer. Basically a platform engineer, but working with tools for sales, CX and marketing. I'm slowly transitioning back to FE engineering.

I run a publication about complex systems at [Despite Complexity](https://despitecomplexity.com).

#### Previous experiences
- CBS Students (Vice President) -> Lotta student politics and working with volunteers
- Siteimprove (Student Developer) -> FE development in React, TS
